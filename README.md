📊 Education Readiness & Equity Dashboard (UDISE+ 2023–25)

A data-driven analytics project developed for the Datathon for Data-Driven Policy Innovation, focusing on evaluating India’s state-level educational readiness using UDISE+ 2023–24 & 2024–25 datasets.
This repository includes the complete workflow — data preprocessing in Python, growth metric engineering, and Tableau dashboards for infrastructure, access, and equity analysis.

🚀 Project Overview

This project transforms large-scale UDISE+ data into an actionable intelligence framework to support evidence-based public policy.
Using cleaned and engineered indicators (Infrastructure Index, Digital Infra Index, GER, GPI, PTR, Retention, YoY Growth %), the dashboards reveal:

i) Regional gaps in educational readiness
ii) Correlations between infrastructure and enrollment
iii) Digital access impact on gender parity
iv) Teacher availability influence on retention
v) Year-on-year progress across key states

🧮 Data Processing Workflow

Tools: Python (pandas, numpy)

Key steps:

i) Cleaned and normalized multi-year UDISE attributes
ii) Standardized state/district names and column formats
iii) Engineered YoY Growth % for Infra, Digital, GER, GPI, PTR, Retention
iv) Exported a unified dataset for Tableau visualization

📊 Tableau Dashboards

Built using Tableau Public / Desktop:

1) Education Readiness & Equity Overview
– National KPIs, state-wise readiness maps, infrastructure distribution

2) Performance & Growth Analysis
– Infra vs GER correlation, Digital vs GPI, YoY Infra Growth Map

3) Integrated Story Dashboard
– Holistic narrative combining growth, access, and equity indicators

Each view includes captions and policy interpretations for public decision-making.

🧠 Key Insights

i) Infrastructure and teacher balance strongly influence enrollment and retention
ii) Digital expansion alone doesn’t guarantee gender parity
iii) Northeastern and central states show lower readiness and growth
iv) High-growth states demonstrate balanced progress across multiple indicators

🏛️ Policy Recommendations

i) Balanced physical–digital infrastructure investment
ii) Gender-focused digital inclusion initiatives
iii) PTR optimization for improved retention
iv) Regional readiness missions targeting low-growth states
v) Performance-linked funding using an annual Readiness Index
